Language detection using deep learning and one-hot encoding under natural language processing


The objective of this project is to propose a language detection model that utilises a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with dropout regularisation to reduce overfitting. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of sentences from various languages, including English, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Mandarin, Japanese, Marathi, and an unsegmented language. The aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in handling multilingual data and to showcase the importance of utilizing deep learning techniques for language detection tasks. The project also aims to evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a test set consisting of sentences from the same languages and demonstrate its high accuracy in identifying the language of the text.

The evaluation of the model's performance using the accuracy score and confusion matrix provides a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities. The accuracy score offers an overall measure of the model's effectiveness, while the confusion matrix reveals a detailed breakdown of the model's performance for each language. This nuanced evaluation enables the identification of areas where the model excels or struggles, informing potential improvements and refinements. The proposed system has applications in translation services, language identification, and content moderation, and it can be adapted to handle more complex language identification tasks. Overall, the system provides accurate and reliable results and can guide future research and development efforts in natural language processing.
